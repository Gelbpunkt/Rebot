# Rebot
Rebot is a small bot originally written by @Diniboy1123 for a request to help mobile users invoke the built-in Discord client commands.

It currently has all the Discord client commands (`/tts`, `/me`, `/tableflip`, `/nick`, `/giphy`, `/xivdb`) except tenor, but it'll come soon too.

The bot is in a very alpha state. So except bugs and be patient!

## Installation
It isn't a very feature rich bot so why would you host it, but if you can instead of self hosting, use the official invite: [Click!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=496342781065953282&scope=bot&permissions=738253888)
However if you really want to host it, you will need Python 3.5 (or higher) and pip3 installed.
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Rename the example `config.py.default`  file to `config.py` and insert all your tokens there
 - Do `python3 Rebot.py` (or it can be `python Rebot.py` under some installations)
